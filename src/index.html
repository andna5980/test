        <div class="left-about-container">
            <p>Kefir is a cultured, sour, acid, yogurt-like drink abounding with good bacteria and yeast, it contains
                more friendly probiotics than any regular yogurt.</p>
            <p>It is made by adding kefir culture (aka grain) to milk from a cow, sheep or goat, then letting the
                mixture ferment for about 24 hours. Once it's strained, it's good to go.</p>
            <p>These are not cereal grains, but grain-like colonies of yeast and lactic acid bacteria that resemble a
                cauliflower in appearance.</p>
            <p>Originating from the Caucasus mountains, Kefir has been a trusted dietary staple for over 2,000 years.
                The word literally means ‘feel good’, and with over 40 strains of gut-friendly cultures.</p>

        <div>
            <h3>More Powerful Probiotic Than Yogurt</h3>
            <p>Contains up to 61 different microorganisms, making it a much
                more potent source of probiotics than many other fermented dairy products.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Low in Lactose </h3>
            <p>As its lactic
                acid bacteria have already pre-digested the lactose. People who have lactose
                intolerance can often drink kefir without problems.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Improve bone / digestive problems </h3>
            <p>Kefir made from dairy is an excellent source of calcium lowering the risk of osteoporosis. Its probiotics
                also led to improvements in digestive diseases.</p>

            <p>I used to have a urinary tract infection for over 20 years. I was on antibiotics for almost 2 decades and
                nothing seemed to work. Last May I was introduced to the world of live probiotics and ever since all my
                UTIs have vanished.</p>
            <p>I usually tell everybody how good this is and how it can help to reverse so many diseases. I share my
                milk grains with my family and friends.</p>

            <p>Greetings. I'm still having great success with my Kefir. And to think I couldn't drink milk without the
                reaction of a bloating stomach for 60 years! Kefir has actually reduced bloating as well as calmed
                nerves, reversed insomnia pattern and taken away carbohydrate cravings.</p>
            <p> Been drinking it for a month now, noticed the benefits immediately. And... my morning kefir smoothies
                keep appetite stable all day... such a blessing, this healing drink! Health and blessings.</p>
